# FalloutLockPicking
Maneuver your bobby pin back and forth to find the sweet spot. Attempt to open the lock by turning it with your screwdriver. Be careful not to break your bobby pins by applying too much pressure. Level up your skills and become a master lock picker!

Was tasked to create a lock picking mechanic in a Game Programming class. Modeled after Fallout 3’s lock picking mechanic. Added some light game elements, including: difficulty, player skill level, and limited bobby pins. Made using Unity, built for HTLM5, and can currently be played at https://austineathorne.itch.io/lockpicking-game.
